C# Challenge from GoToIT

This tool simulates Grading Employees (as Console Application) with the feature of creating them and displaying their statistics.
Employees and statistics are saved to txt files.

Code takes all the lessons from the 21 Days Course such as:
- Interfaces
- Error Handling
- Class inheritance
- Basic elements of C# such as loops, access modifiers etc.
- Unit tests

Liczę na doby feedback ;)
